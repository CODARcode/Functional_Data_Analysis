  Abstract =	 {Bioconductor is an open-source, open-development
                  software project for the analysis and comprehension
                  of high-throughput data in genomics and molecular
                  biology. The project aims to enable
                  interdisciplinary research, collaboration and rapid
                  development of scientific software. Based on the
                  statistical programming language R, Bioconductor
                  comprises 934 interoperable packages contributed by
                  a large, diverse community of scientists. Packages
                  cover a range of bioinformatic and statistical
                  applications. They undergo formal initial review and
                  continuous automated testing. We present an overview
