  The process of gaining ever finer resolution from instruments and
  ever finer discretization in simulations continues to produce more
  data.  In traditional approaches to analysis of such correlated
  data, additional dimensions are used to represent the finer
  discretisation. In this project, fast multivariate analysis
  algorithms are developed for processing this data and for data
  reduction.

  In the longer term, these methods are aiming for paradigm changing
  approaches that utilize modern statistical science and
  mathematics. Functional data analysis (FDA) is an approach that
  replaces finer discretization and finer resolution with mathematical
  complexity, effectively taking the dimensionality to infinity and
  operating in the Hilbert space of functions.

  We approach the development of FDA techniques in CODAR for data
  analysis first and for data reduction second. The most frequently
  used FDA technique is Principal Components Analysis (PCA). We first
  develop interpretable PCA techniques for XGC data in collaboration
  with fusion scientists, addressing mostly data analysis aspects. On
  a longer time frame, we plan to transition these techniques to the
  functional domain while addressing both analysis and data reduction
  goals.
